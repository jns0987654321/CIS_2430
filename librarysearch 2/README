   Included in the librarysearch package is a set of java classes for the library search system.  The user can add a book or a journal at a time and search for the relevant references in terms of a call number, title keywords, or a time period with starting and ending years.  

   To build the system, go one level above "librarysearch" folder and apply the following command:

   javac librarysearch/*.java

   To run the system, you can do either:

   java librarysearch.LibrarySearch

   or 

   java librarysearch.LibrarySearchDemo
